This is a quick symmetry tool for maya, using `maya.cmds`.

## How to install

Make sure you put `QST.py` under `MAYA_APP_DIR\scripts`, for me it is

```
C:\Users\Otaku\Documents\maya\scripts\QST.py
```

Then drag and drop the `dropToInstall.mel` into the Maya viewport, you should have the button on your shelf.
