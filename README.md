# QuickSymmetryTool


This is a quick symmetry tool for maya, using `maya.OpenMaya` and `maya.cmds`.


## How to install


Make sure you put `QSTFuncs.py` and `QST_UI.py` under `MAYA_APP_DIR\scripts`, for me it is

```
C:\Users\Otaku\Documents\maya\scripts
```

Then drag and drop the `dropToInstall.mel` into the Maya viewport, you should have the button on your shelf.


## How to use


Select the points in the middle of the model. Reset them with button. ***This command is NOT Undoable!***. Backup your model.


Select one edge in the middle. Enable symmetry mode with button.


Select the area with button. (***Highlighted*** section will be preserved)


Click execute. Done!
